Host About_Me: Hi!I'm John. I've lived in the neigborhood for almost two years.  I work at home, am happy to make package delivery easier on my neighbors, and am excited to help build a sense of community here in Clinton Hill.

Availability: I'm available all day Monday-Friday, except when indicated.  If I have to step out when a package is on its way, I'll make sure one of my roommates or my next door neighbor is available to get the package.
