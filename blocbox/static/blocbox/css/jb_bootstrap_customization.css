/*	this is blocbox/static/blocbox/css/jb_boostrap_customization.css
		to override the settings in bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/boostrap.css
		for guidancce, see: 	http://bootstrapbay.com/blog/customize-bootstrap/
		
		Some notes on customization
		1. we need to load the customized CSS sheet after we load boostrap.min.css to enable the overrides (e.g., in the head of the html file)
		2. to customize the style, just re-define the style here. dont add your own style names - use the boostrap style names, with customized properties
				e.g., the following lines of code will remove the border-radius around ".btn" but keep everythign else the same 
				
				.btn {
						border-radius: 0px;
				}
		
		3. i've started some customizations below
