Update Git so that we can push to two remotes, so it automatically pushes to github and it pushes to the server?
	git remote set-url --add --push origin git://another/repo.git
	git remote set-url --add --push origin git://one_more/repo.git
So when you push to origin, it will push to both repositories

1. create superuser accounts for john, also maybe me so we dont need to log in as root

1. transfer the host for blocbox.co to the digitalocean server: 
1. EDIT host profile page so it looks different if youre  connnecte d- like {%if registered} 
2. add a forgot password/chnage password
3. START A SHIPMENT process -if connected - start programming that


3. create host table - subset of core_userinfo
4. create pickup_from and pickup_to, see if we can use time field types


#Long Term
 -- add a thank you/confirmation email for the users that signup with WITHOUT CONNECTING
--Fix the admin site/ can be more intuitive/cleaner
--Particularly need to updat the Connections mode view in admin - want to see the connectiosn from each host
-- ADD FIELD: phone_number
-- embed SMS notificaitons
