Update Git so that we can push to two remotes, so it automatically pushes to github and it pushes to the server?
	git remote set-url --add --push origin git://another/repo.git
	git remote set-url --add --push origin git://one_more/repo.git
So when you push to origin, it will push to both repositories

#done
